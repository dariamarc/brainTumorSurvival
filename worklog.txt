1. The input data has size of (155, 240, 240, 4). Since 155 is not a number suitable for the U-Net architecture I have to pad the input images to an even number (160).
Other options include resampling, but that could cause data loss, and cropping, but cropping may actually cut parts of the image that are of interest.
2. The input is too big and it is memory intensive to compute these dimensions. Solution: downscale to (64, 128, 128, 4) using cropping like the one I did for ACDC dataset.
